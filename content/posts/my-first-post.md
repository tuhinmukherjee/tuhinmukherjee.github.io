I’m starting this blog for a couple of reasons. The first is noise. There’s a lot of it around AI, technology, economics, and almost everything else. Opinions travel faster than facts, and hype usually beats evidence. This blog is my way of filtering noise and focusing on signal.

The second reason is learning overload. For most of my career, I’ve felt stuck between three worlds: things I didn’t do and regret, the present reality, and things I want to do someday. For a long time, I believed these worlds were separate. Lately, I’ve realized they’re not. I can bridge them by continouse learning, reflecting honestly, and figuring out how to deal with overload instead of running from it.

Final reason - I want to make sense of work, failure (more about it below), and everything in between. I want to build a habit of reflection, and a space to think out loud.

## What I’ll Be Writing About

I’m not writing this blog with a specific audience in mind. If anything, I’m writing it for *past me* and for anyone who feels overwhelmed, curious, or slightly lost.

Topics here can range widely:
* AWS architectures and real-world cloud lessons
* AI and system design, beyond buzzwords
* Career growth, mistakes, and course corrections
* Tools I actually use and trust
* Movies, quotes, ideas, and observations that stick with me
* There’s no fixed boundary. If something teaches me a lesson, it probably belongs here.

## On Failure (and Why This Time Might Be Different)

One topic I care deeply about—and will write about often—is failure. We underestimate how frequently we fail compared to how rarely we succeed. Most meaningful success comes from getting one or two things right after failing ten, a hundred, or a thousand times.

I’ve tried writing before. Diaries as a kid. Journals as an adult. Blogs that never survived. Most of them failed. This blog exists despite that history, not because of the absence of it. Maybe this time it sticks. If it doesn’t, that’s fine too. Trying still counts.

## Closing Thoughts

I believe learning works best in public. There’s no finish line—there’s always more to understand, more to question, more to connect. I’ll use this space to catalogue what I learn, as honestly as I can.

If you’re reading this and having a hard time, keep going. You’re not alone. You’ve got a friend here. I believe in you—and I hope you believe in yourself too.
